## 😄 About me

✌️ Hello. My name is Alexey. I've been programming since I was 7 years old. Basics, Pascal, C, Assembler, Pearl, Lisp... The list is very long and I don't want it to stop expanding. Performance optimization is my passion. I believe that any code can be improved without losing its clarity. Let's collaborate and create innovative backend solutions together!

🎓I have experience in HTML5, CSS3, JS, React.js and Node.js. Also I have three team projects and two individual projects. In two projects I was been a developer and a scrum-master, and we develop an Filmoteka site, using JS, HTML5, and CSS. I enjoyed learning something new, I want to grow up as a specialist and develop more difficult websites.

👩‍💻 I graduated from GoIT school and now I continue to deepen my knowledge in programming.
